# Android Messages™ Desktop <a href="#"><img src="resources/icons/48x48.png" alt="Android Messages Desktop logo" title="Android Messages Desktop logo" /></a> 

Run Android Messages as a desktop app, a la iMessage. For those of us that prefer not to have a browser tab always open for this sort of thing.

### Disclaimer: I have tested this with my Pixel on both macOS High Sierra and Windows 10. Normal functionality seems to work, but help testing and feedback is greatly appreciated!

* [Google Play Music Desktop Player](https://github.com/MarshallOfSound/Google-Play-Music-Desktop-Player-UNOFFICIAL-)
* [a Reddit post on r/Android](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/8shv6q/web_messages/e106a8r/)

Based on:

# Download
Head over to the [latest releases](https://github.com/chrisknepper/android-messages-desktop/releases/latest) page!

* For Mac, choose the **dmg**
* For Windows, choose the **exe**
* For Linux, choose either the **deb**, the **snap**, the **pacman**, or the **AppImage**. If you're using Arch or derivatives of Arch, it's also available in the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/android-messages-desktop/).

**Important note:** The Windows app binary isn't signed. This doesn't seem to be a big problem, but please report any issues you run into on Windows that may be related to signing.

**Important note 2:** We currently have builds for Windows and macOS, and Linux. I've only tested on macOS and Windows 10, and would love help testing on Linux and older versions of Windows.

# Features

* System notifications when a text comes in
* Notification badges on macOS
* Multi-language spell checking including saving custom words
* Run in background on Windows / Linux / macOS
* Minimize to tray on Windows / Linux
* Menu bar support on macOS
* TBD...

# TODOs / Roadmap (rough order of priority):

- [x] Make sure it actually works (definitely works as of v0.1.0, done via [8068ed2](../../commit/8068ed2))
- [x] Release signed binaries for macOS (binaries are signed as of v0.0.2, done via [8492023](../../commit/8492023))
- [x] Make an icon (done via [df625ba](../../commit/df625ba))
- [x] Remove left-over code from electron-boilerplate (done via [4e7638a](../../commit/4e7638a))
- [ ] Correct tests
- [x] Release packages for Linux (done via [41ed205](../../commit/41ed205))
- [x] Handling updates (done via [625bf6d](../../commit/625bf6d))
- [x] Platform-specific UX enhancements (i.e. badges in macOS dock) (this specific enhancement is in as of v0.1.0, done via [8068ed2](../../commit/8068ed2)) **UX enhancements and features are now being worked on with issues submitted by users**
- [ ] Release signed binaries for Windows
- [ ] Make a website? (if it gets popular enough)
- [ ] Support customization/custom options a la Google Play Music Desktop Player?

# Development
Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed, then run the following in your terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/chrisknepper/android-messages-desktop.git
cd android-messages-desktop
npm install
npm start
```

## If `npm install` fails:
Introducing [`electron-spellchecker`](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-spellchecker) means introducing what is known in the Node world as a "native" module, which are not distributed as binaries. In other words, some low-level code needs to be compiled on your local machine. There are a couple of "gotchas" associated with this which may break installing/running/building the app until you address them.

### Windows:
The module `node-gyp` must be able to run on your system, which you should be able to do following the [Windows instructions](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#option-1) via `windows-build-tools`.

### Linux:

You must have the following packages installed:

* libxext-dev
* libxtst-dev
* libxkbfile-dev

These packages should be installable from your system's package manager, i.e. in Ubuntu/Ubuntu-like systems:
`sudo apt-get install libxext-dev libxtst-dev libxkbfile-dev`

### Mac:
You probably need the Xcode Command Line Tools. I am unsure if `xcodebuild` is necessary.

### All platforms:
Node and Python 2.x are required. Mac and Linux should always have Python 2.x, and the above instructions should result in it being installed in Windows.

If starting/building still doesn't work, try using `electron-rebuild` per [their instructions](https://github.com/electron/electron-rebuild#how-does-it-work):

`$(npm bin)/electron-rebuild`

Or if you're on Windows:

`.\node_modules\.bin\electron-rebuild.cmd`

## Starting the app in development mode
```
npm start
```

# Testing
Run all tests:
```
npm test
```

## Unit
```
npm run unit
```
Using [electron-mocha](https://github.com/jprichardson/electron-mocha) test runner with the [Chai](http://chaijs.com/api/assert/) assertion library. You can put your spec files wherever you want within the `src` directory, just name them with the `.spec.js` extension.

## End to end
```
npm run e2e
```
Using [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) and [Spectron](http://electron.atom.io/spectron/). This task will run all files in `e2e` directory with `.e2e.js` extension.

# Making a release
To package your app into an installer use command:
```
npm run release
```

Once the packaging process finished, the `dist` directory will contain your distributable file.

We use [electron-builder](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder) to handle the packaging process. It has a lot of [customization options](https://www.electron.build/configuration/configuration), which you can declare under `"build"` key in `package.json`.

# The icons
We use [png2icons](https://www.npmjs.com/package/png2icons) to create Windows and Mac icons from the source PNG icon, which is located in [assets/android_messages_desktop_icon.png](assets/android_messages_desktop_icon.png). However, the Windows icon generated from this package seems to result in visual corruption on Windows 10, so I'm manually converting the PNG to a Windows icon with [icoconvert.com](http://icoconvert.com) for the time being.
